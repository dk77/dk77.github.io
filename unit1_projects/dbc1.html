	<h5>Childhood</h5>
	<p> I spent almost all of my early life living in Seattle. As a child I loved video games, sports, and reading.</p>

	<h3>Hobbies</h3>
	<p> Even though current events and the news used to bore me to death, I actually really enjoy reading up on what is happening around the world and watching documenatries about other cultures. <br>I still try to stay active and love playing sports but unfortunately I have developed weak knees so I have had to stick to low impact excercises. </p>

	<h5> Education</h5>
	<p><i> In high school I had a hard time choosing where to go to school. I eventually chose Western Washington University over Washington State University. <br>I never found my true passion in college even though I went through four different majors while I was in school. I ended up majoring in psychology.  </i></p>
