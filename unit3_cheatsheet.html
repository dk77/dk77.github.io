I've come to find out that although Ruby and Javascript have many similarities, the differences between them sometimes result in
frustration because of the minor differences. After coding for a while in one language I feel that I often make mistakes when I need to 
do another task in the second. This was our groups reasoning behind taking a the array, which for us is a basic component (yet something 
that we have been using quite a bit in both languages), and compare and contrast certain aspects of the two. We decided on focussing on 
creating, adding to, and deleting from arrays.

I have found that the most helpful cheat sheets do several things. Firstly, they stay away from trying to talk about too many different topics.
That is why we stuck to only the creation, adding to, and deleting from of arrays. Second, they remove anything that distracts the reader. This doesn't 
have to mean heavily contrasting colors or wierd font, it could be something like being redundant in trying to explain something or using words
and phrases that are too advanced for the audience. Our sheet is purposfully simplistic and concise, but I think that is an advantage when it comes to
distracting the reader. The last thing is providing examples of what you are trying to explain. This one is pretty self-explanatory. We purposfully
used very simple examples as not to confuse the reader.

The site that we drew inspiration from and helped me a great deal during my study sessions is: https://agentcooper.github.io/js-ruby-comparison/
